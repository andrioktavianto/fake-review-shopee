# Identifying Fake Review on Shopee using Logistic Regression

Raw data acquired from Shopee (shopee.co.id) through scraping

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using the most updated version of Python.

## Result
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@andrioktaviantox/identifying-fake-review-on-shopee-using-logistic-regression-1b2551474b59).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to https://github.com/darshandagly/Fake-Review-Detection for the idea and code for maximum number of reviews, review length, and cosine similarity. Also thanks to Shopee for the data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
